Taylor exceeded expectations right out the door with his ability to pick up full process flows and new technologies quickly. In his one year with us, Taylor has continued to sharpen his skills and we've been able to trust his design decisions every step of the way. He has been a great addition to our team and I look forward to working with him more now and in the future.`,

While he may not have always been the student who instantly understood each concept the moment it was taught, his work ethic and determination placed him at the top of the class project after project. He is a joy to be around, and he can always be seen with a smile on his face. After I re-entered the industry, I personally tried to refer Taylor onto my team, and I would be thrilled to work with Taylor in the future.`,
